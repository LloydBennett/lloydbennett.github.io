          Help Steel Warriors tackle knife crime through design
        </h3>
        <p>
          Steel Warriors is a London-based charity that provides gyms to
          transform the lives of young people affected by crime, violence and
          social exclusion, giving them the skills and confidence to succeed in
          life. Spectacularly, the gyms that Steel Warriors provides are made
          using steel collected by melting down confiscated knives.
        </p>
        <p>
          Steel Warriors needed another round of funding from their investors,
          to progress with their ongoing initiatives to tackle knife crime.
          One of the KPIs they needed to achieve to get funding was by tracking
          data and activity of people using their gyms. Steel Warriors wanted
          to do this in way which enriches and enhances the experience of using
          their facilities. Steel Warriors approached thoughtbot with an ambitious
          plan of developing a digital platform to support their physical offering.
          At the outset we discussed a series of broad features:
        </p>

        <ul class="list">
          <li class="list__item">
            Fitness Tracking
          </li>
          <li class="list__item">
            Workout Instruction
          </li>
          <li class="list__item">
            Community Building
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Once we downloaded all of the information about their business
          goals and needs we set to work with a research phase.

            Gathering user insights
          </h3>
          <p>
            We began our research phase by attending a Steel Warriors training
            session at their gym in Ruskin Park. While at the workout session
            we spoke to the athletes (users) that participated as well as
            Simone, one of Steel Warriors’ trainers. Some comments we received
            were <q><i>I’m afraid of heights so there is definitely a fear factor to
            contend with</i></q>, <q><i>Nearly every exercise today was new to me</i></q>
            and <q><i>Gym’s like these have amazing communities</i></q>.
          </p>
          <p>
            From those conversations it became apparent that the training and
            instruction is the key value proposition for Steel Warriors. This
            insight helped us to pivot our focus to investigating how we could
            deliver a digital experience that both teaches users workout techniques
            and helps them to organise workout routines.

          Reviewing fitness apps in the market
        </h3>
        <p>
          We looked at the following mobile apps Strava, Nike Run Club & Yoga
          Studio as we felt they aligned the aforementioned features.
          We mapped out the most common user flows and tried to identify
          the product’s unique selling proposition.
