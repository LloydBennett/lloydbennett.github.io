          Create an optimal experience that encourages customer conversion
        </h3>
        <p>
          Bluvalt is a cloud computing service based in Saudi Arabia, focused
          on providing affordable and locally-tailored computing resources
          for SME businesses. Think <a href="https://www.heroku.com/" target="_blank" class="link">Heroku</a>
          or <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/" target="_blank" class="link">Digital Ocean</a>
          but tailored for Saudi tech start-ups. Bluvalt launched several social media campaigns
          to increase customer engagement and acquisition. Even though they had
          a high click through rate, they found 95% of their visitors on average
          would only spend 30 seconds on their website.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bluvalt believed their low customer conversion stemmed from the
          overall design and experience of their website. To solve this issue,
          Bluvalt hired software design and development agency thoughtbot to
          redesign their website for a better user experience. My remit on the
          project was to carry out the visual and interaction design.
