          Help Steel Warriors tackle knife crime through design
        </h3>
        <p>
          Steel Warriors is a London-based charity that provides gyms to
          transform the lives of young people affected by crime, violence and
          social exclusion, giving them the skills and confidence to succeed in
          life. Spectacularly, the gyms that Steel Warriors provides are made
          using steel collected by melting down confiscated knives.
        </p>
        <p>
          Steel Warriors needed another round of funding from their investors,
          to progress with their ongoing initiatives to tackle knife crime.
          One of the KPIs they needed to achieve to get funding was by tracking
          data and activity of people using their gyms. Steel Warriors wanted
          to do this in way which enriches and enhances the experience of using
          their facilities. Steel Warriors approached thoughtbot with an ambitious
          plan of developing a digital platform to support their physical offering.
          At the outset we discussed a series of broad features:
        </p>

        <ul class="list">
          <li class="list__item">
            Fitness Tracking
          </li>
          <li class="list__item">
            Workout Instruction
          </li>
          <li class="list__item">
            Community Building
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Once we downloaded all of the information about their business
          goals and needs we set to work with a research phase.
