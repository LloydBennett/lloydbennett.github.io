<h3 class="project__subheading center">Introduction / Brief</h3>

<div class="copy-wrapper">
  <p>The directors Leicestershire based at Media Design agency ‘Seed Creativity’ ran a
  module on my university degree called “Creative Media Entrepreneurship”.
  As part of the module we were required to choose an existing employer and pitch a product idea or campaign.
  Having undertaken research on some potential employers for the assignment I had come across a vast number of
  digital design agencies in Leicestershire. I noticed Seed Creativity themselves had fallen short of a strong digital
  presence that their competitors possessed. Their current site didn’t provide their consumers with usable and rich
  experience which is required today. The need for a re-design was evident.</p>

  <p>Seed Creativity required a responsive and bespoke re-design to connect more effectively
  with their consumer base. I pitched this idea to company directors,which they loved.
  The plans for development of the re-design shortly commenced.</p>

  <h3 class="project__subheading center">Design Process</h3>

  <div class="copy-wrapper">
    <h4>User Research</h4>
    <p>The project undertaken in a very agile and iterative approach as both company directors
    and I consistently arranged regular meetings to maintain a high level communication.
    Tools such as Trello, Google Docs and Invisionapp were key in the management and auditing
    throughout the design process. The project began by fleshing out business objectives company
    directors and began which then led to undertaking qualitative research methods such as
  user surveys and observations to understand the type of users I was required to design for.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="copy-wrapper">
    <h4>Information Architecture</h4>
    <p>Once we knew who exactly we were designing for it enabled me and the company directors devise a
    strong information architecture for the new re-design by creating site maps, content audits and
    wireframes.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="copy-wrapper">
    <h4>Visual Design</h4>
    <p>Using the information gathered from the previous stages, I able to produce a high level visual pixel-perfect
      mockups and interaction storyboards for both mobile and desktop views using Photoshop. A lot of the project was
      spent on this phase due to large number of iterations request by the product owners. These designs were then presented
      to an external company called Effect Digital for review as they were going to be involved in the back-end development of the site. </p>
  </div>
  <div class="copy-wrapper">
    <h4>Development</h4>
    <p>I then built a responsive prototype using HTML,CSS, Sass &amp; jQuery. Versions of this prototype was committed regularly through
      git and allowing the back-end developers to track to the process. </p>
