            </h2>
            <p class="wow moveUpFade" data-wow-duration="700ms" data-wow-delay='500ms'>Leicestershire based Media Design agency and training provider, Seed Creativity ran a module in my university programme called “Creative Media Entrepreneurship”. As part of the module I was required to choose an existing company and pitch a product idea. Having undertaken research on several digital enterprises in the Leicestershire area, I noticed that Seed Creativity themselves, lacked an engaging and rich web experience that met the needs of the modern consumer. Seed Creativity required a re-design that was responsive and showcased their services effectively. I pitched this idea to the company directors, which they loved. The plans for the re-design shortly commenced.</p>

        <p class="wow moveUpFade" data-wow-duration="700ms" data-wow-delay='500ms'>
            In order to carry out a successful website re-design, it was important that myself and the company directors fully understood who we were targeting. We needed to consider the main reasons why their targeted users would visit the Seed website and try to use this information to cultivate a web experience that aids their goals. A business needs analysis was carried out with the company directors where I managed gather list of both their current and potiential clientele. This then led to me getting into contact with them and carrying out user tests (surveys, usability tests).</p>

                        The information gathered from the previous stage enabled me to a create visual blueprint of the website structure. Using a mobile-first approach to creating these wireframes encouraged the company directors and I to be really critical over our content by cutting out the fat. We used this opportunity to also map out possible user journeys.

                <p>All in all, the core needs of project were met. Seed received a solution which was mobile friendly and allowed them to update their content where necessary. Furthermore, they were able to market their new consultation effectively as it was the forefront of their site. With that said, to enhance the outcome of the project, It would have been beneficial to have had more frequent communication with Effect Digital. This would have improved the quality of the project and I would have been able to point out any misalignments along the way.</p>

                <p>Throughout this process I have learnt a lot about myself as a designer. I have been able adapt my style of work to incorporate the feedback of others to better the design. From this I have built confidence within my abilities to meet the needs of the client.</p>
