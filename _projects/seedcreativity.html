<h3 class="project__subheading center">Introduction / Brief</h3>

<div class="copy-wrapper">
  <p>Leicestershire based Media Design agency, Seed Creativity ran a module my university programme
    called “Creative Media Entrepreneurship”. As part of the module I was required to choose an existing
    employer and pitch a product idea. Having undertaken research on digital enterprises in the Leicestershire area,
    I noticed that Seed Creativity themselves, lacked an engaging and rich web experience that met the needs of the modern consumer.
    Seed Creativity required a re-design was malleable and communicated the vision of the brand effectively. I pitched this idea to
    company directors, which they loved. The plans for development of the re-design shortly commenced.</p>

  <div class="copy-wrapper">
    <h4>User Research</h4>
    <p>The project began by fleshing out business objectives company
    directors which then led to undertaking qualitative research methods such as
  user surveys and observations to understand the type of users I was required to design for.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="copy-wrapper">
    <h4>Information Architecture</h4>
    <p>Once we knew who exactly we were designing for it enabled me and the company directors devise a
    strong information architecture for the new re-design by creating site maps, content audits and
    wireframes.</p>

  <div class="copy-wrapper">
    <h4>Visual Design</h4>
    <p>
      Using the information gathered from the previous stages high-fidelity visual
      mockups(Mobile/Desktop) and interaction storyboards were produced using Photoshop. A lot of the project was
      spent on this phase due to large number of iterations request by the product owners.</p>

      <p>These designs were then presented to an external company(Effect Digital) for review as they were going to be
        implement the back-end of the site. </p>

    <h4>Development</h4>
    <p>I then built a responsive prototype using HTML,CSS, Sass &amp; jQuery. Versions of this prototype was committed regularly through
      Git and allowing the back-end developers to track to the process. </p>

  <h3 class="project__subheading center">Reflection</h3>
  <div class="copy-wrapper">
    <p> Having this project been my first commercial project and carried out the planning and design right through to front-end development
      by myself was quite a daunting experience at times. Especially when came to the front-end development aspects of the product, there a
      concern as to whether the quality of the code I produce will be massively hindered by inexperience. However, I used my initiative to utilise
      source code quality tools such as W3C validator and JShint.</p>
