<h3 class="center">Introduction / Brief</h3>

<p>The directors Leicestershire based at Media Design agency ‘Seed Creativity’ ran a
module on my university degree called “Creative Media Entrepreneurship”.
As part of the module we were required to choose an existing employer and pitch a product idea or campaign.
Having undertaken research on some potential employers for the assignment I had come across a vast number of
digital design agencies in Leicestershire. I noticed Seed Creativity themselves had fallen short of a strong digital
presence that their competitors possessed. Their current site didn’t provide their consumers with usable and rich
experience which is required today. The need for a re-design was evident.</p>

<p>Seed Creativity required a responsive and bespoke re-design to connect more effectively
with their consumer base. I pitched this idea to company directors,which they loved.
The plans for development of the re-design shortly commenced.</p>

  <h4>The Big Digital Switchover</h4>
  <p>The “Big Digital Switchover” is a marketing campaign that provides a consultation
  and a workshop to educate their clients about the digital marketing platforms available
  at their disposal and how it can impact on customer retention. This was at the forefront
  of their sales pitch to win new customers. We delegated the main masthead section on the
  homepage to this campaign.</p>
