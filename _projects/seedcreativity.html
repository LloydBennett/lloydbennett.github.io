                <span>A Re-Design For </span><span>The Modern Web</span>
            </h3>
            <p>Leicestershire based Media Design agency and training provider, Seed Creativity ran a module my university programme called “Creative Media Entrepreneurship”. As part of the module I was required to choose an existing employer and pitch a product idea.Having undertaken research on several digital enterprises in the Leicestershire area, I noticed that Seed Creativity themselves, lacked an engaging and rich web experience that met the needs of the modern consumer. Seed Creativity required a re-design that was malleable and communicated the vision of the brand effectively. I pitched this idea to company directors, which they loved. The plans for the re-design shortly commenced.</p>

        <p>In order to carry out a successful website re-design, it was important we understood who were targeting, why they may visit the site and what they may be looking for.This information was learnt in discovery phase through a business needs analysis with the company directors. This then led to getting into dialogue with their clients and carrying out user tests (surveys, usability tests).</p>
