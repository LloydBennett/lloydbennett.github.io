<h3 class="project__subheading center">Introduction / Brief</h3>

<div class="project__para-block">
  <p>The directors Leicestershire based at Media Design agency ‘Seed Creativity’ ran a
  module on my university degree called “Creative Media Entrepreneurship”.
  As part of the module we were required to choose an existing employer and pitch a product idea or campaign.
  Having undertaken research on some potential employers for the assignment I had come across a vast number of
  digital design agencies in Leicestershire. I noticed Seed Creativity themselves had fallen short of a strong digital
  presence that their competitors possessed. Their current site didn’t provide their consumers with usable and rich
  experience which is required today. The need for a re-design was evident.</p>

  <p>Seed Creativity required a responsive and bespoke re-design to connect more effectively
  with their consumer base. I pitched this idea to company directors,which they loved.
  The plans for development of the re-design shortly commenced.</p>
