               Toad London is a young and emerging creative agency that produces
               advertising campaigns, websites, mobile apps and content for brands.
               Since the turn of the year 2016, Toad wanted to undertake a new strategy
               to win over new business by using their recent successes on projects as
               the focal point of their sales pitch. With this in mind, the company directors
               felt their current site didn&apos;t align with their goals and wanted to undertake a
               website re-design which includes the following feature set:</p>

            <h2>Choosing A Suitable Framework</h2>
            <p>Having analysed the requirements company directors, we (the development team) came
               to the conclusion that using a framework or library on this project would be a good idea
               as this will be idea as we were on a tight schedule. We chose a JavaScript framework
               called Vue.js for these following reasons: </p>

            <ul class="list">
               <li>
                  <p>
                     <strong>Small in file size &amp; fast rendering</strong> &ndash; Ideal for this project as this is a small site.
                  </p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <p>
                     <strong>Easy to learn</strong>
                  </p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <p>
                     <strong>A focus on the view layer in MVC pattern</strong> &ndash; This site is purely for visual and marketing purposes
                     so the fact the library has a focus on the presentational layer meshes well with the goal of the site. This also limits the chances of
                     library giving us unnecessary features we don&apos;t we need.
                  </p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <p>
                     <strong>Preserves many of the core JavaScript MVC features </strong> &ndash;
                     such as asynchronous page loading (routing), event binding and enforces modular written code by
                     building components.
                  </p>

      <h2>Design Began On The Computer</h2>
      <p>High fidelity mock-ups of the site were created very early in the design process.
         This approach forced many avoidable design revisions that could have been discovered
         at lower design level (wireframes) or even through more thorough discovery process.
         This approach also caused a lot of back and forth between design and development as mock-ups were
         being built as they were being designed due to being on a tight schedule.

            <h2>Modular Approach To Design</h2>
            <p>
               Combating the constant design revisions whilst maintaining on track of the development schedule we
               executed the following:
            </p>

            <ul class="list">
               <li>
                  <p>
                     <strong>Dissect the design into smaller pieces</strong> &ndash;
                     Analysed any repetition, behaviour, relationships between UI elements such as buttons
                     in the design and built them as reusable web components and templates.
                  </p>
               </li>

               <li>
                  <p>
                     <strong>Write modular CSS code</strong> &ndash; that was flexible for design revisions and reusable.
                  </p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <p>
                     <strong>Descriptive and meaningful folder names</strong> &ndash;
                     This made navigating around folders easy and fast thus allowing us to be more
                     productive.
                  </p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <p>
                     <strong>Challenged design revisions</strong> &ndash;
                     Some revisions were purely aesthetic that didn&apos;t provide any value
                     to the site going forward, those were the ones we challenged.
                  </p>
               </li>
            </ul>
            <p>As a whole this sped up development time. The components I worked on are as follows:</p>

            <h2>Outcome</h2>
            <p>
               The website was delivered and was able to support the companies'
               forthcoming sales pitches. The company was able to refer potential clients
               to our site in conversation with great confidence.
            </p>
            <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
            <p>
               Reflecting on this project although was able to deliver a marketing
               site of high quality that represents the Toad brand well, I felt there
               was a number of areas where we failed on the project:
            </p>
            <ul class="list">
               <li>
                 <p>
                    <strong>Was a JavaScript Framework really needed?</strong>&ndash;
                    The sort answer is no. Looking back at what we built in the end we didn't build
                    anything nearly as sophisticated and large enough to suggest a JavaScript framework.
                    In fact using a framework was actually an overkill as there was a lot features were not essential
                    to the project and we constantly broke out of the frameworks' structure to meet our needs.
                    We were actually better of writing the features we needed ourselves.
                 </p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <p>
                     <strong>We didn&apos;t validate whether our solution was successful</strong> &ndash;
                     When building a solution to a problem it's essential that you validate whether the
                     experiment was successful or not. After the project completed there was no evidence of that as we focused
                     sorely on whether the company directors felt the final outcome deemed fit to launch and not test
                     the solution with the targeted audience.
                  </p>

               </li>
               <li>
                  <p>
                     <strong>Design Started On The Computer</strong> &ndash;
                     This approach to design created a number of issues in project that caused us to push on back on deadlines.
                     The design process is arguably one of the most crucial aspects to the success or failure project
                     as it paves the direction as to what will get built. This isn't something you want to skip or rush even
                     if you have a time constraint. Undertaking a more thorough design process would have
                     been beneficial to us as it would have removed a lot of the guesswork that resulted in constant design revisions
                     as well as provided us with the opportunity validate our initial ideas on a solution with our targeted audience.
                     Through this process we may have found out that a entire redesign was not necessary for our problem and perhaps minor changes
                     would have suffice. This would have been more cost effective for the company going forward.
