 <p>Leicestershire based Media Design agency, Seed Creativity ran a module my university programme
    called “Creative Media Entrepreneurship”. As part of the module I was required to choose an existing
    employer and pitch a product idea. Having undertaken research on digital enterprises in the Leicestershire area,
    I noticed that Seed Creativity themselves, lacked an engaging and rich web experience that met the needs of the modern consumer.
    Seed Creativity required a re-design was malleable and communicated the vision of the brand effectively. I pitched this idea to
    company directors, which they loved. The plans for development of the re-design shortly commenced.</p>
