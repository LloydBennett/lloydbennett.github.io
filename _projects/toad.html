      <p>Toad London is a young and emerging creative agency that produces
         advertising campaigns, websites, mobile apps and content for brands.
         Since the turn of the year 2016, Toad wanted to undertake a new strategy
         to win over new business by using their recent successes on projects as
         the focal point of their sales pitch. With this in mind, the company directors
         felt their current site didn&apos;t align with their and wanted to undertake a
         website re-design which includes the following feature set:</p>

      <ul>
         <li>
            <strong>Case Studies</strong> &ndash; To sell the narrative and process behind each project
         </li>
         <li>
            <strong>Animation Driven</strong> &ndash; To provide a engaging experience for users and showcase what they can do.
         </li>
         <li>
            <strong>Minimal</strong> &ndash; In style but effective and memorable.
         </li>
