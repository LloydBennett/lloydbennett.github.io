      <p class="wow moveUpFade" data-wow-duration="700ms" data-wow-delay='500ms'>Toad London is a young and emerging creative agency that produces
         advertising campaigns, websites, mobile apps and content for brands.
         Since the turn of the year 2016, Toad wanted to undertake a new strategy
         to win over new business by using their recent successes on projects as
         the focal point of their sales pitch. With this in mind, the company directors
         felt their current site didn&apos;t align with their and wanted to undertake a
         website re-design which includes the following feature set:</p>

      <ul class="list">
         <li class="wow moveUpFade" data-wow-duration="700ms" data-wow-delay='800ms'>
            <p>
               <strong>Case Studies</strong> &ndash; To sell the narrative and process behind each project.

         <li class="wow moveUpFade" data-wow-duration="700ms" data-wow-delay='1.1s'>
            <p>
               <strong>Animation Driven</strong> &ndash; To provide a engaging experience for users and showcase what they can do.

      <h2>Choosing A Suitable Framework</h2>
      <p>Having analysed the requirements company directors, we (the development team) came
         to the conclusion that using a framework or library on this project would be a good idea
         as this will be idea as we were on a tight schedule. We chose a JavaScript framework
         called Vue.js for these following reasons: </p>

      <ul class="list">
         <li>
            <p>
               <strong>Small in file size &amp; fast rendering</strong> &ndash; Ideal for this project as this is a small site.
            </p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p>
               <strong>Easy to learn</strong>
            </p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p>
               <strong>A focus on the view layer in MVC pattern</strong> &ndash; This site is purely for visual and marketing purposes
               so the fact the library has a focus on the presentational layer meshes well with the goal of the site. This also limits the chances of
               library giving us unnecessary features we don&apos;t we need.
            </p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p>
               <strong>Preserves many of the core JavaScript MVC features </strong> &ndash;
               such as asynchronous page loading (routing), event binding and enforces modular written code by
               building components.
            </p>
         </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Design Began On The Computer</h2>
      <p>High fidelity mock-ups of the site were created very early in the design process.
         This approach forced many avoidable design revisions that could have been discovered
         at lower design level (wireframes) or even through more thorough discovery process.
         This approach also caused a lot of back and forth between design and development as mock-ups were
         being built as they were being designed due to being on a tight schedule.

      <h2>Modular Approach To Design</h2>
      <p>
         Combating the constant design revisions whilst maintaining on track of the development schedule we
         executed the following: </p>

      <ul class="list">
         <li>
            <p>
               <strong>Dissect the design into smaller pieces</strong> &ndash;
               Analysed any repetition, behaviour, relationships between UI elements such as buttons
               in the design and built them as reusable web components and templates.
            </p>
         </li>

         <li>
            <p>
               <strong>Write modular CSS code</strong> &ndash; that was flexible for design revisions and reusable.
            </p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p>
               <strong>Descriptive and meaningful folder names</strong> &ndash;
               This made navigating around folders easy and fast thus allowing us to be more
               productive.
            </p>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p>
               <strong>Challenged design revisions</strong> &ndash;
               Some revisions were purely aesthetic that didn&apos;t provide any value
               to the site going forward, those were the ones we challenged.
            </p>
         </li>
      </ul>
      <p>As a whole this sped up development time. The components I worked on are as follows:</p>
