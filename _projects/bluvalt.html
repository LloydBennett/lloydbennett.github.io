            Bluvalt is a cloud computing service based in Saudi Arabia.
            The that was encountering high bounce rate on their marketing site.
            Which you can imagine was impacting on their customer acquisition.
            The company also had strong reservations on the visual design of their
            site as were a lot of inconsistencies and was looked dated.
          </p>
          <p>
            Bluvalt hired thoughtbot to conduct research, analyse findings and execute
            on strong visual language that would both lower bounce rates and gain traction. My remit on the project was to focus on the latter.

            After reviewing users activity on the website on Fullstory we learnt
            that users often felt lost as they move their mouse around, attempt
            to click on a few things that would lead them on a dead end page and
            then leave the site all together. We set an overarching goal for the
            site and goals for each individual page.

          I created an inspiration / mood board of visuals that I felt would
          best convey the brand and presented this to the client. Undertaking
          this step before fleshing out any mock-ups made the client feel involved
          in the process and prevented excessive design revisions going forward.
          Together we decided to go down a playful illustrative direction that has
          an emphasis on the working Saudi community. We wanted to remove the typical
          “serious”, “nerdy” and “enterprise” feel about computing and create something
          that resonated with the local community.
