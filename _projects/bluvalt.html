            Bluvalt is a cloud computing service based in Saudi Arabia.
            The that was encountering high bounce rate on their marketing site.
            Which you can imagine was impacting on their customer acquisition.
            The company also had strong reservations on the visual design of their
            site as were a lot of inconsistencies and was looked dated.
          </p>
          <p>
            Bluvalt hired thoughtbot to conduct research, analyse findings and execute
            on strong visual language that would both lower bounce rates and gain traction. My remit on the project was to focus on the latter.

          After reviewing users activity on the website on Fullstory we learnt
          that users often felt lost as they move their mouse around, attempt
          to click on a few things that would lead them on a dead end page and
          then leave the site all together. We set an overarching goal for the
          site and goals for each individual page.
