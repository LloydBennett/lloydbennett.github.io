        <h3>
          Create an optimal experience that encourages customer conversion
        </h3>
        <p>
          Bluvalt is a cloud computing service based in Saudi Arabia, focused
          on providing affordable and locally-tailored computing resources
          for SME businesses. Think <a href="https://www.heroku.com/" target="_blank" class="link">Heroku</a>
          or <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/" target="_blank" class="link">Digital Ocean</a>
          but tailored for Saudi tech start-ups. Bluvalt launched several social media campaigns
          to increase customer engagement and acquisition. Even though they had
          a high click through rate, they found 95% of their visitors on average
          would only spend 30 seconds on their website.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bluvalt believed their low customer conversion stemmed from the
          overall design and experience of their website. To solve this issue,
          Bluvalt hired software design and development agency thoughtbot to
          redesign their website for a better user experience. My remit on the
          project was to carry out the visual and interaction design.

            Setting goals and wireframming

          <p>
            After reviewing users activity on Bluvalt’s website we noticed many
            users were becoming lost. We came to the conclusion that the
            high bounce rate was due to a lack of clarity in the value proposition
            and a poor information architecture. We saw this as a good point to
            take a step back and try to understand the goal(s) of the website.
            Understanding the goal empowered us to make better design decisions
            when crafting a new user journey.

        <p>
          I created an inspiration / mood board of visuals that I felt would
          best convey the brand and presented this to the client. Undertaking
          this step before fleshing out any mock-ups made the client feel involved
          in the process and prevented excessive design revisions going forward.
          Together we decided to go down a playful illustrative direction that has
          an emphasis on the working Saudi community. We wanted to remove the typical
          “serious”, “nerdy” and “enterprise” feel about computing and create something
          that resonated with the local community.

          Developer Hand-off
        </h3>
        <p>
          The typical designer to developer hand off consists of a bunch of
          Sketch files with annotations being thrown over the wall with the
          expectation that the developer(s) will be able to make sense of it.
          In my experience this approach usually doesn’t end well. To avoid this
          I created an HTML & CSS prototype of the website. This allowed the
          client’s internal development to work more efficiently as they had
          ready made code available to convert into React components.

          <p>
            thoughtbot delivered a new web experience and a cohesive visual
            language for Bluvalt.com. This generated lots of positive feedback
            and sharing from customers on social media. Most importantly,
            the website bounce rate reduced by an impressive 35%. Bluvalt also
            benefited largely from the high level of communication and
            transparency we maintained during our engagement with them,
            through daily stand-ups, retrospectives and demos. They felt involved
            in the design process and understood every decision being made.
