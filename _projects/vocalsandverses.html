            Vocals & Verses is a spoken word and live music event based in London.
            Vocals & Verses aims to provide a soulful and mature vibe where upcoming artists can display
            their ability to an impressionable new audience. Since it's inception in March 2011,
            Vocals & Verses has utilised digital platforms such as Twitter, Facebook and email marketing to
            interact with their audience. However their current website has often been neglected and hasnâ€™t
            provided our customers with the quality of experience to consistently pull in traffic.
            With the increasing demand of rich user experiences in digital products and the company's aim to
            become the leading brand for spoken word and live music in UK, Vocals & Vocals would need to
            re-evaluate their online proposition in order remain on course with the long term goals.
