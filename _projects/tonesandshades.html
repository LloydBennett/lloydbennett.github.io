paragraph:
  - text: As a black man I witness racial discrimination on a frequent basis.
          This could be any thing from racial slurs being use on the street or
          in media outlets all the way through to being misrepresented corporate
          jobs. One of the main reasons I believe racism still exists is that
          theres a lack of education and accountability. I believe that if I
          can could use my design skills to give my fellow black counterparts a
          voice to share their life stories this can inform, educate and inspire
          change.
  - text: I wanted also to champion their successes so people can see how strong,
          bold and amazing we are. We have been oppressed for centuries and now
          we have the opportunity to be heard. I’m a firm believer that charity
          starts from home so I chose to focus my efforts specifically with black
          creatives. I teamed up with my former work colleague Miles, who shared
          the same vision and we got to work towards creating a digital magazine
          for black creatives.
