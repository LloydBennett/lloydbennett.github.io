        I’m a web designer based in London. I’m a massive Manchester United
        fan and I have an interest in brand identities and how they play a presence
        in UI design. I believe that when anyone interacts with a digital product,
        they should be able to see personality and characteristics of that brand
        shining through. Everything from the choice of colour to the animation
        within the digital product should clearly reflect brand's identity.

            My journey as a designer, started from learning some basic HTML &amp; CSS
            skills at university.

          <p>
            I developed a love-hate relationship with positioning
            elements on a web page with CSS, which I, ironically, found stimulating.
            I noticed my curiosity for creating websites grew as I started to ask myself
            why my websites looked awful and lacked consistency on different internet browsers'.
            These type of questions spurred me to delve deeper into the web design field.
            I invested in online courses to further my web design knowledge and scoured the
            internet for the best web designs. With an impressed yet curious mind,
            I challenged myself; to try to break these designs down in granular pieces,
            emulate them and try to put my own spin on them. This was my way of trying to
            learn how to design.

            Fast forward a few years, I'm now a Product Designer at
            thoughtbot, building and validating digital products for small to medium
            sized enterprises. I now have of a broad scope of what design is, which
            incorporates: understanding business objectives, real user needs and ultimately
            knowing the right product to build.

        While I welcome projects at any stage of their development, I mostly
        enjoy Greenfield projects. I’m driven by the notion of turning ideas
        into reality, being part of the journey from the birth of the idea
        through to the launch. I like to involve each client in the creative
        process and I take pride in working towards a shared goal with them.
        My mission is to always produce work that goes beyond their expectations.
        With that said, I really enjoy working on digital platforms which have
        a strong emphasis on visual design and brand identity.

        My goal as a designer is simple, and timeless; to consistently
        build elegant digital experiences that fulfil their purpose.
        Additionally, I aim to share my knowledge and experience with
        others to provide value.
