        Hi my name is Lloyd, I’m a Digital Designer based in London.
        I’m a massive Manchester United fan and I have an interest in brand

          Understand
      </h4>
      <p>
        I gather insights on both your business and your customers. This allows me to understand: what problem we are
        trying to solve? who we are designing for? What assumptions do we need
        to validate? This information allows us to set the goals and objective(s)
        that the proposed design solution will need to meet.

        Create A Strategy
      </h4>
      <p>
        This consists of generating flow diagrams, sketches, wireframes to
        paint a picture of how I will approach the problem. I share these
        thoughts with you and together we formulate a strategy.

        Prototype &amp; Validate
      </h4>
      <p>
        The sooner we can put something in front of customers for feedback,
        the better. This mitigates any risk of us shipping a product that your
        customers won’t use. The prototype is usually a clickable low-fidelity
        (black and white) design of your product, which your customer will
        engage with in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usability_testing" class="link" target="_blank">user testing</a> session.

        Visual Communication
      </h4>
      <p>
        From brand experiences to product design, I align with the values of your business
        to develop a visual identity that communicates the brand message. Everything from
        colour, type, imagery and animations is well thought out. I pride myself in crafting simple, functional and purposeful design systems.

        Delivery
      </h4>
      <p>
        For me delivery doesn’t end in a design file. Delivery is about giving
        you something tangible that your customers can engage with, written in
        production level code. Once the product is complete it’s essential that
        we review where we started and if we met our goals.
