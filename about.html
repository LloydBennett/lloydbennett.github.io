      Introduction
    </h2>
    <h3>
      Lloyd Bennett
    </h3>
    <p>
      I’m a digital designer based in London. I’m a massive Manchester United
      fan and I have an interest in brand identities and how they play a presence
      in UI design. I believe that when anyone interacts with a digital product,
      they should be able to see personality and characteristics of that brand
      shining through. Everything from the choice of colour to the animation
      within the digital product should clearly reflect brand's identity.

      Ideal Projects
    </h2>
    <h3>
      Taking ideas to market
    </h3>
    <p>
      Greenfield projects are my favourite as I am able to take an idea and turn
      it into a reality. This allows me to be part of the journey from the birth
      of the idea right through to the execution. I love working towards a shared
      goal with my clients and going beyond their expectations. With that said,
      I really enjoy working on digital platforms which have a strong emphasis
      on visual design and branding identity.

      The Journey
    </h2>
    <h3>
      From novice to Senior Designer
    </h3>
    <p>
      My journey as a designer, started from learning some basic HTML and CSS
      skills at university. I developed a love hate relationship with positioning
      elements on a web page with CSS which I weirdly found simulating. I noticed
      my curiosity for creating websites grew as I started to ask myself 'why did
      my websites look awful and lack consistency on different internet browsers?'
      These types questions spurred on me to delve deeper into the web design field.
      I invested in online courses to further my web design knowledge and scoured
      the internet for the best web designs. As I gazed at these stunning looking
      websites in amazement, I would to try to break the design down in granular pieces,
      steal those ideas and try to put my own spin on them. This was my way of trying
      to learn how to design. Fast forward a few years, I'm now a Senior Designer at
      thoughtbot, building and validating digital products for small to medium sized
      enterprises. I now have of a broad scope of what design is, which incorporates:
      understanding business objectives, real user needs and ultimately knowing the
      right product to build.
