      "Hi my name is Lloyd, I’m a Digital Designer based in London.
      I’m a massive Manchester United fan and I have an interest in
      brand identities and how they play a presence in UI design.
      I believe that when anyone interacts with a digital product,
      they should be able to see personality and characteristics of
      that brand shining through. Everything from the choice of colour
      to the animation within the digital product should clearly reflect
      the brand's identity."

        My goal as a designer is simple, and timeless;
        to consistently build elegant digital experiences that fulfil their
        purpose. Additionally, I aim to share my knowledge and experience
        with others to provide value.

          01 Understand
        </h3>
        <p>
          I gather insights on both your business and your customers. This allows me to understand: what problem we are
          trying to solve? who we are designing for? What assumptions do we need
          to validate? This information allows us to set the goals and objective(s)
          that the proposed design solution will need to meet.

          02 Create A Strategy
        </h3>
        <p>
          This consists of generating flow diagrams, sketches, wireframes to
          paint a picture of how I will approach the problem. I share these
          thoughts with you and together we formulate a strategy.

          03 Prototype &amp; Validate
        </h3>
        <p>
          The sooner we can put something in front of customers for feedback,
          the better. This mitigates any risk of us shipping a product that your
          customers won’t use. The prototype is usually a clickable low-fidelity
          (black and white) design of your product, which your customer will
          engage with in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usability_testing" class="link" target="_blank">user testing</a> session.

          04 Visual Communication
        </h3>
        <p>
          From brand experiences to product design, I align with the values of your business
          to develop a visual identity that communicates the brand message. Everything from
          colour, type, imagery and animations is well thought out. I pride myself in crafting simple, functional and purposeful design systems.

          05 Delivery
        </h3>
        <p>
          For me delivery doesn’t end in a design file. Delivery is about giving
          you something tangible that your customers can engage with, written in
          production level code. Once the product is complete it’s essential that
          we review where we started and if we met our goals.
