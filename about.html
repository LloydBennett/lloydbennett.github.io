            Hi my name is Lloyd, I’m a Digital Designer based in London.
            I’m a massive Manchester United fan and I have an interest in
            brand identities and how they play a presence in UI design.
            I believe that when anyone interacts with a digital product,
            they should be able to see personality and characteristics of
            that brand shining through. Everything from the choice of colour
            to the animation within the digital product should clearly reflect
            the brand's identity. My goal as a designer is simple, and timeless;
            to consistently build elegant digital experiences that fulfil their
            purpose. Additionally, I aim to share my knowledge and experience
            with others to provide value.

            My journey as a designer, started from learning some basic HTML and CSS
            skills at university. I developed a love-hate relationship with positioning
            elements on a web page with CSS, which I, ironically, found stimulating.
            I noticed my curiosity for creating websites grew as I scoured the internet
            for the best web designs and tried to figure out how they were made.
            With an impressed yet curious mind, I challenged myself;  to try to break
            these designs down in granular pieces, emulate them and try to put my own
            spin on them. This was my way of trying to learn how to design. Fast forward a few years, I'm now building and validating digital products for small to medium sized enterprises. I now have of a broad scope of what design is, which incorporates: understanding business
            objectives, real user needs and ultimately knowing the right product to build.
