        I’m a digital designer based in London. I’m a massive Manchester United
        fan and I have an interest in brand identities and how they play a presence
        in UI design. I believe that when anyone interacts with a digital product,
        they should be able to see personality and characteristics of that brand
        shining through. Everything from the choice of colour to the animation
        within the digital product should clearly reflect brand's identity.

        Greenfield projects are my favourite as I am able to take an idea and turn
        it into a reality. This allows me to be part of the journey from the birth
        of the idea right through to the execution. I love working towards a shared
        goal with my clients and going beyond their expectations. With that said,
        I really enjoy working on digital platforms which have a strong emphasis
        on visual design and branding identity.

        The Journey
      </span>
      <h3>
        <span class="no-wrap-and-break">From novice to</span>
        <span class="no-wrap-and-break">Senior Designer</span>
      </h3>
      <p>
        My journey as a designer, started from learning some basic HTML and CSS
        skills at university. I developed a love hate relationship with positioning
        elements on a web page with CSS which I weirdly found simulating. I noticed
        my curiosity for creating websites grew as I started to ask myself 'why did
        my websites look awful and lack consistency on different internet browsers?'
        These types questions spurred on me to delve deeper into the web design field.
        I invested in online courses to further my web design knowledge and scoured
        the internet for the best web designs. As I gazed at these stunning looking
        websites in amazement, I would to try to break the design down in granular pieces,
        steal those ideas and try to put my own spin on them. This was my way of trying
        to learn how to design. Fast forward a few years, I'm now a Senior Designer at
        thoughtbot, building and validating digital products for small to medium sized
        enterprises. I now have of a broad scope of what design is, which incorporates:
        understanding business objectives, real user needs and ultimately knowing the
        right product to build.
