      <p>My first love for the web emerged sometime in the summer of 2013
        after my first year of University. I realised the endless possibilities
        with HTML5 & CSS3 in creating beautiful and engaging websites.
        Since then, Iâ€™ve been plugging away at mock-ups in Photoshop / Sketch
        through to front-end code, striving to create the best possible user experiences.
        In my spare time I like to keep up to date with the latest trends and news in design.
        A Chrome Plugin called Panda, makes this experience all the more enjoyable as it aggregates
        all the latest articles and posts from my favourite websites such as Awwwards, HackingUI,
        Medium and Dribbble in one tab. I am currently available to take on projects, so feel free
        to contact me regarding any work or enquires.
