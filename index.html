				<p class="wow moveUpFade" data-wow-duration="700ms" data-wow-delay='500ms'>My first love for the web emerged sometime in the summer of 2013 after my first year of University. I realised the endless possibilities with HTML5 &amp; CSS3 in creating beautiful and engaging websites. Since then, Iâ€™ve been plugging away at mock-ups in Photoshop / Sketch through to front-end code, striving to create the best possible user experiences.</p>

				<p class="wow moveUpFade" data-wow-duration="700ms" data-wow-delay='800ms'>In my spare time I like to keep up to date with the latest trends and news in design. A Chrome Plugin called <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/panda-hacker-news-dribbbl/jhiocdmmaannaccoofjfmjpbfkogmnap?hl=en" class="link" target="_blank">Panda</a>, makes this experience all the more enjoyable as it aggregates all the latest articles and posts from my favourite websites such as Awwwards, HackingUI, Medium and Dribbble in one tab.
