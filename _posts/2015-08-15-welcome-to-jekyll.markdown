This is post is a reminder to myself about all the negative things I’ve done and are currently do as a young designer that is hindering my personal development. Hopefully you can relate to this post as well. The message is simple just create!

* Don’t worry about make mistakes in projects because you will learn more effectively this way.
* Don’t hesitate to write things down.

* Don’t compare yourself to anyone else.
* Don’t be against using a front-end framework like bootstrap in your project
⋅⋅* In that regard don’t be against using any third party tools. Your NOT required to build everything - a good craftsman is aware of the tools available to him/her and knows how and when to use them.
* Don’t get wrapped in making your work perfect because theres no such thing
* Don’t care about what others think of you and your work
* Don’t get procrastinate because there is someone else out there fulfilling your dream
* Don’t over think things
* Don’t try to know everything before you begin
* Don’t get too frustrated if your work looks wack in the beginning - you have to create a mountain of work under you before the good work starts to arrive
* Never discredit yourself - always give yourself a pat on the back at the end of each project even when you don’t like the work you’ve created.
